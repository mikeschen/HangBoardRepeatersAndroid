\u2022 Be sure to be properly warmed-up before using the fingerboard. Laps first on boulder problems or routes is highly recommended.
\n \u2022 Starting with a set on the jug holds of the hangboard is also recommended.
\n \u2022 When hanging on a hold, fingers should be in a half-crimp position. The arms should be in a very slightly bent position, the muscles should be “engaged”.
\n \u2022 Hang from the hold on the hangboard for the number of seconds you entered.
\n \u2022 Pause for the number of seconds you entered.
\n \u2022 Repeat for the number of rounds you entered.
\n \u2022 Rest for the number of seconds you entered. At least 90 seconds is recommended.
\n \u2022 Repeat for the number of sets you entered.
\n \u2022 A recommended workout for beginners is 5 hangs of 8
seconds each, with 5 seconds rest between hangs. This is 1 set. You will do a total of 5 sets
(so 25 total hangs), resting 3 minutes between each set.
